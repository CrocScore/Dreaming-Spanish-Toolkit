# Dreaming-Spanish-Toolkit

## About The Project
* I taught myself some JS with the Odin Project but stopped using it for a while, so I'm making this to try and code a little bit again

## How To Use The Project
* Look in the [completed](https://github.com/spruce04/Dreaming-Spanish-Toolkit/tree/main/completed) folder for things that are finished and can be used, and the [inProgress](https://github.com/spruce04/Dreaming-Spanish-Toolkit/tree/main/inProgress) folder for things you could work on if you'd like to help with them
* Current Finished Scripts: 
    * [monthlyStats.js](https://github.com/spruce04/Dreaming-Spanish-Toolkit/tree/main/completed/monthlyStats.js) &rarr; Gives total time and daily averages for selected months
* Current work(s) in progress
    * [videoTimeStats.js](https://github.com/spruce04/Dreaming-Spanish-Toolkit/tree/main/inProgress/videoTimeStats.js) &rarr; Gives the combined length of all videos depending on whatever filters are used (not sure if this would be possible with the website as it is - if you try it you'll see what I mean)
    * [Chrome Extension](https://github.com/spruce04/Dreaming-Spanish-Toolkit/tree/main/chrome-extension) &rarr; A chrome extension that can have the functionalities of all the current finished scripts for easy use
    
## Possible Future Ideas
* dark mode?
